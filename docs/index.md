# Overview

This documentation describes KLIX checkout solution integration. Multiple integration scenarios are covered:

* Simple merchant home page that does not have an in-built shopping cart functionality. Klix Widget can be predefined to allow to buy a specific product. Klix Widget HTML code should be placed on a product page. No additional technical integration actions need to be performed by the merchant if orders are managed in Klix.
* Custom built or standard e-commerce platform web-shop. In this case besides placing Klix Widget HTML code on merchant check-out page bidirectional API integration should be implemented.
