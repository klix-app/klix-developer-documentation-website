# Overview

This documentation describes [Klix](https://klix.app) payment/checkout solution integration. Multiple integration options are available:

* Klix integration with eCommerce platforms using [plugins](/../plugins-for-ecommerce-platforms). In case your website is built on a one of these platforms (WooCommerce, Shopify, Magento, OpenCart, Prestashop), you will simply need to install our plugin and provide integration configuration.
* Klix integration with any other platform or custom built site using our [API](/../api).
* Klix integration with any site using Klix [Widget Legacy API](/../widget-api). This integration option is supported only for merchants with existing integration and is deprecated for a use in new merchant integrations.
